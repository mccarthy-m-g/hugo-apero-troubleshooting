      <description>Details     A website is a wonderful place for showcasing yourself, mobilizing knowledge in your learning community, building an online portfolio, or anything else you can imagine! Thanks to the power of open source software, creating a stylish website is quick, easy, and free. No programming experience required.
In this workshop we will explore open source tools and workflows for creating and deploying websites. By the end of the workshop you will have your very own website up and running on the web; bring a picture and bio so you can begin to customize your site!</description>

      <description>Tidy Tales is a data science blog meant to demonstrate the skills needed in a typical data science project. Namely, wrangling, visualizing, modelling, and communicating data, all with the assistance of programming. The blog takes its name from the tidy data framework for structuring data, and from its narrative style. My inspiration for the blog came from Tidy Tuesday, a weekly data project for practicing and building data science skills with real-world data.</description>

      <guid>/talk/2021-02-12_reproducible-manuscripts/</guid>
      <description>Details     This workshop covers principles and practices important for making your manuscripts reproducible by other scientists (or future you). We will learn about these principles and practices and how to implement them through a fake scientific paper, written by Bones and Spock from the television series Star Trek: The Original Series, made for showcasing how to write reproducible manuscripts in R Markdown.
This workshop is a followup to my talk, Doing reproducible science.</description>

      <description>Event Details     | Speaker: Michael McCarthy | Date and Time: January 1, 2021, from 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM | Location: University of Calgary
What is reproducibility and why is it important that your scientific work is reproducible? Reproducibility refers to a scientific pipeline whose steps, processes, procedures, and results can be reproduced by other scientists (or future you), ensuring that results can be verified, and that the decisions that led to those results can be understood.</description>

      <description>A wrapper for the &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; HTML commands in R. It allows you to embed multimedia files in HTML documents generated by R using R code instead of raw HTML. Its functions also include arguments for including placeholder text instead of embedded multimedia files when generating non-HTML documents in R.</description>
